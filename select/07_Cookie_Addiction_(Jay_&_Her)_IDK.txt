Drop that cookie on the floor
Pick up it up and let it go
Drop that cookie on the floor
Pick it up and get that money

You bang that pussy yours
But I'm goin' make you shit
Yeah
Cus see that syndrome that's strummin' on your heart
At the start when I make your legs part
Like a part in my room in my apartment
Pardon my thoughts
Okay let's start with you on top
I'm nasty and you know it
You a shy chick don't wanna show it
But every time I take you to the bed I ain't even gotta ask
You just make a nigga blast when you blow it
Yeah it's been a couple of times when I blew it
But the dick's so good that you forget it
And if it ever come back in your memories
I just bend you over then I hit it
Damn you fat as fuck
I need to buckle up
Before I ride inside it like a passenger
I'm like a pilot, pilot
Crash land it, land it
On an island, island
When I'm in your guts
Oh lord (ahh lah)
Everything goes on when the clique grows on
And the crew leaves two weeks
Except for you
When I'm whippin up the two
Like what we 'bout to do?

I don't need no hook
All I need is this
All I need is a bag of the weed and you
Right next to the pit
Oh lord
We goin' in brah
Oh lord
We bout to take off
I see we about to take off

Drop that cookie on the floor
Pick it up and let it go
Drop that cookie on the floor
Pick it up and get that money

Why every single time I'll be like chill
You be like what that mean?
If you know damn well when I come through
We be getting buck nasty
In the dorm room I'll be like
Shh
The roommate tryna do her homework
But we got our own work
And it won't hurt if she come through when
Get a little bit of dick too
I'm nasty and you know it
You a shy chick don't wanna show it
But every time I take the time you take your tiny
Body to the top and we get naughty
Likelihood to fall in love is hardly
But I love the way you ain't too hardly
Award for nigga when I hear you get a good award
Scratch my back
Call me nigga like a slave on a wood
Get high
Drink true
After that we can do what we do
If you want we can try something new
That's right I'm a bring the whole crew
It's like damn I'm just playing
But everything goes on (Oohh la la)
When the clique grows on
And the crew leads too
Except for you
When I'm whipping up for two
Like what we bout to do?

I don't need no hook
All I need is this
All I need is a bag of the weed and you
Right next to the pit
Oh lord
We goin' in brah
Oh lord
We bout to take off
I see we about to take off

I don't need no hook
All I need is this
All I need is a bag of the weed and you
Right next to the pit
Oh lord
We goin' in brah
Oh lord
We bout to take off (off off)

Drop that cookie on the floor
Pick it up and let it go
Drop that cookie on the floor
Pick it up and get that money

Cus I don't need no hook
All I need is this
All I need is a bag of the weed and you (and you)
Right next to the pit
Oh lord
We goin' in brah (oh lord)
Oh lord
We bout to take off (ooh ooh yeah)
